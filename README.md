# Pandemic

This is an AI for the board game Pandemic. 
Made for a SSRP research project  at Ohio Wesleyan University.

## Buiding

This project uses the Gradle build system. 

To run, use the included `run.sh` script or type `./gradlew run`

To compile a .jar file, do `./gradlew dist`

Most IDEs have support for importing gradle projects, which is probably a good idea for this project.
We used Intellij Idea.
